## Overview of standard Functions
Azure Functions are a serverless solution to letting you run your code.  Functions manages the
infrastructure your code runs on.  You set up triggers and bindings in order to start execution
of your code.

Triggers specify what event will begin code execution; that could be a HTTP request,
a blob being added to blob storage, or a message being added to a message queue.

Bindings specify declarative connections to resources. For example, rather than specifying how to connect and then
write output to blob storage inside your Functions body, you specify what resource you want and the necessary
credentials, then Functions will provide you with a ready-to-go SDK client object to interact with that resource.
In that sense, triggers are a type of binding.

## Overview of Durable Functions
Azure Durable Functions are an extension of traditional Azure Functions.  Standard Azure Functions are simple; they
are just a function or method with trigger and binding attributes.  Durable Functions are different in that
there are four categories a Functions function / method can fit into: client, orchestrator, activity, and entity.

### Activity Functions
Activity Functions are essentially just traditional Functions; the only difference is that they are now being run
in the context of Azure's Durable Functions, so need a name to distinguish it from the other introduced types.  You
can specify triggers and bindings just like with traditional functions.  They can only have one value passed to them,
so have to use tuples, arrays, or complex types.

### Client Functions
The term Client Functions is more of a general umbrella term used to describe any function / method that uses the durable
client output binding.  The durable client output binding delivers messages to the Task Hub
that are intended to be received by orchestration and entity trigger bindings.  Specifically, a client function uses
the orchestrator client and entity client output bindings to send messages to the Task Hub to trigger orchestrator and
entity triggers respectively.  So, client functions are used to initiate orchestrator and entity functions.

Orchestrator functions cannot be client functions.  Orchestrator and entity functions cannot be triggered directly
in Azure Portal, you must run a client function to start them instead.  The durable client binding can also be used to
interact with running orchestration and entity functions.

### Orchestrator Functions
Durable Functions are functions / methods that execute actions.  Example actions include: activity functions,
sub-orchestrations, HTTP requests, and times.  There are strict requirements for how orchestrator code must be
written.

They can call all other types of Durable Functions including other orchestration functions.  Output from those calls
can be assigned locally.  Execution is checkpointed using the event sourcing pattern at every await / yield statement;
if a function is restarted for some reason and it runs an activity function, the Durable Task Framework (DTF) will replay
the result of the function to avoid rerunning it.  Orchestrator code must adhere to the constraints below in order for
replaying to work correctly.  They have an unlimited time lifespan.  Every orchestration instance is assigned a unique
instance ID.

At each orchestration checkpoint (i.e. at `yield` / `await` statements), the DTF will typically save execution history
into storage, enqueue messages for functions the orchestrator wants to invoke, and finally enqueue messages for the
orchestrator itself.  Each time an orchestrator is resumed after waiting for a task, it will be rerun from the start.
The DTF will check execution history to see if that task / activity 


#### Constraints


### Entity Functions
Entity Functions are functions / methods that explicitly manage state via reads and writes.  They are triggered with a
special entity trigger.  They have no code constraints like orchestrators.
